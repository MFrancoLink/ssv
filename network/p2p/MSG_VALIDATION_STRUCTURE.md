# Message Validation Properties


### Problem

Current node implementation is susceptible to network attacks.
- Example: a malicious node can send several messages to the subnet, causing a DoS attack.
- Main target of such network attacks may be the BLS verificatoin task, which is cpu consuming (on average 5ms).

### Goal

Design a Message Validation mechanism to prevent DoS attacks. This mechanism will rely on
- Syntax (format) verification
- Semantic verification
- Knowledge of expected messages according to qbft's logic
- Knowledge of expected messages according to duty's logic

## Attacker specification


> An attacker is any node acting differently from the defined behaviour by ssv.

- An attacker may have taken control of a node, possessing a share key.
- It can be a malicious network scheduler, delaying or tampering messages.
- An attacker can't, however, produce an impersonation attack (to be able to produce a digital signature of a key it doesn't have).


## Classifier abstraction

A main component of the mechanism can be abstracted as a classifier. The possible classifications are:
- "Accept": for messages that passes through all filters.
- "Reject": for messages that either
    - go against the protocol specification (malicious)
    - are invalid
    - may be an attempt of a DoS attack.
    
    The sender should be penalized.

- "Ignore": valid messages that shouldn't be processed but doesn't harm the protocol (as non-committee validator messages).

> **Note**
> This classification is due to the `libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub` validation classification.

The main classifier metric we should care is:
- Recall (Sensitivity): ratio of true positives from all positive samples (the lower the recall, the more honest messages we decided to reject or ignore).

For our context, the classifier may tolerate processing some malicious messages but it **must** process every honest message. Therefore, the recall (or sensitivity) metric over "Accept" messages should be the one focused by the classifier.

Note: though the recall should be optimized, the response system below is a mechanism that avoids receiving subsequent non honest messages.

## Response systems

Using a good classifier, the response system will actually combat and prevent DoS attacks.

It accomplishes this by:
- associating a `rejection score` (a non-negative value) to each peer in the network.
- stop listening to a peer, for a certain time frame, when its score is bigger than a certain threshold value.
- increasing the rejection score when messages are rejected.
- decreasing the rejection score upon honest messages.


The scores can be reset or updated on each epoch, slot or QBFT round.

There's room for flexibility but we propose:
- an start rejection score of 0.
- a threhsold of 30.
- a decrease of 2 per honest messages.

The increment amount on the rejection score due to a rejected messages is determined by the rejection rule.

## Classifier structure

- The classifier shall be built on top of rules.
- If the message doesn't pass a certain rule, the rule triggers a classification tag and an error for this message.
- If a message is accepted by every rule, it's considered a valid message.

## Rules

- Each rule has a classication tag, a code and an associate rejection score.
- **Ethereum Alignment:** Every rule should respect the Ethereum consensus specification. In other words, no rule should prevent a message following a normal case of any Beacon duty, collaborating with the sensitivity metrics.
- The rule's score is pre-defines and was determined according to the maliciousness of the message.
- The list are divided in the following categories:
    - Syntax
    - Semantics
        - Partial Signature specific semantics
        - QBFT specific semantics
    - QBFT logic
    - Duty logic
        - Attestation specific
        - Attestation Aggregation specific
        - Proposer specific
        - Sync committee specific
        - Sync committee aggregator specific

##### Rules suggestions for future
- Priority-based message handling: priority based on type and sender.
- Deduplication mechanism: discard duplicate messages
- Message aggregation: aggregate similar messages (e.g. wait for quorum of prepares, commits, round-changes, partial-sig) before delivering to the app. ( -> difficult to implement)
